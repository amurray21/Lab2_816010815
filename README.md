# 3006 Lab 2 Repository 


FreeRTOS specifies that port-specific files must be defined for the target platform, and that an 
application-specific configuration file should be included in each new project. 

For any project that you have already created, identify the following files and how changes in any one will affect the FreeRTOS configuration:

<ul type="disc">
        <li> /project/sdkconfig</li>
        <li> /project/build/include/sdkconfig.h</li>
        <li> /sdk/components/freertos/port/esp8266/include/freertos/FreeRTOSConfig.h</li>



<p>For each exercise, ensure that the output file, the appropriately commented source files, and the final binary files, are part of your github repository.</p>

    <ol>
    
        <li>Create an example application with three tasks that are created in app_main.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
